First cut at proposed cflib.org libraries hosted instead on GitHub.

Things to point out:

* [Mixins for compatibility](./src/main/StrLib.cfc#L31-L34)
* [UDF CFCs](./src/main) (I had some copies from the old cflib.org that let you downloaded the whole lib as a component.)
* [Unit test area](./src/test) (not yet populated with real tests)
